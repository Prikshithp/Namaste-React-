  ## Answers -
  - Emmet is a popular abbreviation tool for web developers and programmers. It allows you to write concise snippets of code that expand into much larger code structures.
  - Libraries: Solve specific problems Frameworks: Can be more difficult to change due to their comprehensive nature
  - A CDN, which stands for Content Delivery Network, is a network of interconnected servers spread across the globe. Their main purpose is to speed up the delivery of content to users by bringing it closer to their physical location
  - it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive
  - The crossorigin attribute in a <script> tag is used to specify how the browser handles cross-origin requests when loading an external script file from another domain
  - REACT -> Defines the structure and behavior of your UI (like ingredients and recipe) REACTDOM Renders the UI to the screen (like baking the pizza
  - Development: Use react.development.js during development and testing to have a better debugging experience.
Production: Switch to react.production.js for the final version of your application to ensure optimal performance and user experience.
-  ASYNC -> Non-blocking: The browser downloads the script asynchronously while parsing the HTML, without pausing it
Non-blocking: Similar to async, it doesn't block HTML parsing.
